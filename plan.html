<h1>CP1406 -  Project Plan</h1>

<h2>Name: Khin Yadanar Aung</h2>

<p>&emsp;<strong>StudentID: 13536805</strong></p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The website is intended for membership and concerts. The goals related to membership are to recruit new members and to enhance commitment of individuals in activities, for example, volunteering for adminstration, organising and promoting concerts and workshops. Then, the goals for concerts are to increase ticket sales, especially to the general public, and encourage performers to let the Music Center organise a concert for them and to cooperate with promotion, photo shoots, media releases, etc.</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>

<p>The success of the Townsville Community Music Center website is evaluated by the changes in number of members and ticket sales rate after the website has been created. The number of members and ticket sales in 3 months will be counted and compared to the numbers before developing the Townsville Commmunity Music Center website.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>Although TCMC provides performance opportunities for a very wide range of styles, genres and specialise in diversity, it is more focus on the music such as classical, jazz, ethnic music, etc which is more persuasive for older people, the website aims to target mature people who love classical music and musical shows. Thus, people who are in their 30s and older are mainly targeted when doing TCMC’s announcements and promotions but there will also be some approaches for other age groups because music is all just about the preferences of people which cannot be totally define by their age. However, children under 16 will not be allowed to buy a ticket without their parents’ consents as some musical shows will not be suitable for underages and babies will be prohibited as they can disturb audience.</p>
